##  <tt><b>pyQET ~ the Python Quick Edit Tool</b></tt>
<hr noshade>
<tt>a simple to use 'quick editing tool' written in Python. Scans text and replaces values with ease automatically updating and saving the file</tt>

**a note for novice python users**
**There are two ways of using this script... you can git clone repo and use the script from the terminal,
or you can simply copy and paste the .py script into your own terminal creating your own script. Remember
to have the file that is being edited handy -if not in the same directory as the .py script.**

1. Create a directory to hold script and .txt file that you intend to edit.

2. Initialize the script & when asked what file you are editing, enter the file name and make sure that it matches.

3. The script will ask what string you're replacing, this is where you select what you would like to find and replace within the document.<br>
   **sometimes you must use 'ctrl + c' to move forward after selecting you .txt file**

5. The next thing you will need to imput is the string you would like to use as your replacement.

6. Once you have pressed enter after inserting your desired string, the change will happen immediately and the doc will be saved. Use the 'open' cmd to view your edited file.

<b>Further Reading;</b><br>
<tt>There are obviously plenty of built in tools and functions that could replicate this process with ease. However, this is a testing script, designed to learn from and
use as a framework to add on to or customize. Next steps for development... I would like to add a built in translation feature as well some options to run with the script related to output and file type. Maybe add a feature where the script can determine what type of file is being edited and serve as a makeshift compiler when needed.</tt>

<tt>the idea for this project came about while cloning a template repository for github and needing to remove Chinese characters and replace them with the correct english characters without breaking syntax.</tt>
